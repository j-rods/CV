I'm an enthusiastic Junior full stack Ruby developer specialising in front end, with a solid background in UX Design. Having a keen interest in software development, I decided to make a career change from UX and join Makers Academy, which is the leading developer Bootcamp in Europe. With Makers I have learned the principles of software developer craftsmanship and now I am ready to take on a new challenge where I can blend my expertise in Information Architecture and Interaction Design, with my passion for coding.
