I'm an enthusiastic Junior Front End Developer with a solid background in UX Design. 
 
As a UX Designer I specialised in Information Architecture and Interaction Design. I have been involved from an early stage in the design of user centered interfaces from mobile to desktop. With good awareness of current trends and emerging technologies, I’d take part in producing innovative cross-platform experiences, working closely with product and development teams.
 
I have experience in all stages of project lifecycle, including activity planning, benchmarking(web analytics, competitor analysis), research(card sorting, empathy maps, personas), defining user journeys, wireframes, prototypes, UI Design and testing.
 
Having a keen interest in software development, I decided to join Makers Academy which is one of the leading developer bootcamps in Europe. With Makers I have learned the principles of software developer craftsmanship and now I am ready to take on a new challenge. 
 
I am seeking an opportunity in an environment where I will continue to develop as a front end developer and participate in defining success. This would give me the support to expand my knowledge, improve my skills, learn new techniques and progress professionally.
